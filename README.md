# BikeTrip

Introduction:
To persuade investors that a bike-sharing program is a sound
business idea, more needs to be done. One of the major
stakeholders wants a bike trip study to support the plan. I&#39;ll use
Pandas to convert the &quot;travel duration&quot; column from an integer to a
Date Time datatype for this analysis.

Objectives:
We have following Objectives in this Regard. Some of them are as
follow,
 Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for
all riders and genders.
 Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each
hour of each day of the week.
 Show the number of Bike trips for each type of user and gender
for each day of the week.


Conclusions:
Since, in this project there are three deliverables which is about the
number of bikes checked out and also the trip on the basis of gender
vice versa. We have completed all those deliverables as shown above
through our coding and their Result’s Representation. Also now we
are familiar with the project bike trip Histories.
